## Overview

Connect by creating a story---start with *why*. Usually, you tell your journey from struggle to success. Storytelling boosts conversion rates. Avoid self-praise.

Say how you're going to help visitors specifically. It's always about them, not you. How to do this: instead of focusing on you, focus on how you solve a problem for them.

Use power words, adjectives. Open with a hook, as you would with an article, something that affects them.

Be conversational and choose words that evoke emotion (e.g., *help* instead of *assist*): http://unionez.net/adsezine/Emotions.html

Like any other article, use a benefit-driven headline. Say what you're good at that sets you apart and can benefit the reader. You could also have a sub-headline that further explains your benefits to readers.

Get creative with your unique selling proposition, because there are a lot of freelance writers: success stories, data, statistics, unique abilities that benefit them (e.g. creating copy that gets readers to take definitive action), something unique you do to go above and beyond for clients, etc. Put it above the fold.

Promise a solution to their challenges, from headline to CTA.

Show who you are and what you offer through an image (doesn't have to be your face).

Use concrete accomplishments to establish reliability and authority.

Deliver the most important and relevant info above the fold---don't make them scroll for answers. (Mention 300 clients throughout entire conterminous US, from coast to coast)

Keep it under 500 words, or 2 minutes for a video.

Use at least one CTA to turn a reader into a customer. Make sure it provides value to them and keep it simple.

Suggestion to overcome friction to reading your page: offer something of value for free without an opt-in form. If it's educational, great, because people are more likely to buy from you after you've educated or informed them.

At any rate, if you can teach your audience anything useful, do it. It makes for a very engaging About page. See this example: https://copyblogger.com/about/

Maybe it could be an insight that comes from me only and not the competition; my way of seeing things. Or how I know the ins and outs of English better than native speakers because I have a different perspective. Typos jump out.

Mention Spanish somewhere.

## For a Video

"Hi. My name is ___ and I [value or selling proposition]."

Videos build trust, reduce friction to reading the page, and can increase conversions by 80 percent.
