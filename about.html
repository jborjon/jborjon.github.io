<p>Hi, I'm Joseph, and I live, breathe, and dream writing so you can focus on running your business without ever worrying about your content again.</p>

<h2>My Story</h2>

<p>Growing up in Chile as a Chilean-American, I daydreamed of writing captivating fiction and nonfiction one day. I saw myself dazzling audiences with my magnificent command of the English language.</p>

<p>But there was one problem: I didn't speak English.</p>

<p>Maybe some, but not enough to hold a conversation.</p>

<p>My teachers were always kind enough to commend my vocabulary and grammar in Spanish. <em>One day,</em> I told myself (in Spanish), <em>I'll use English at the same level—maybe even better.</em></p>

<p>I was too young to know how thorny that would prove. So, when I was 18, I embraced my American nationality and moved to the US.</p>

<p>The first years were rough. At my first job, HR got involved when I offended a coworker because the word I used didn't mean what I thought it meant. I was too embarrassed to admit to a language deficiency, so I just promised it wouldn't happen again.</p>

<p>Mistakes and misunderstandings were common. For all my efforts, this English thing wasn't coming along.</p>

<p>Could I really do it?</p>

<p>Little by uphill little, people started noticing my language abilities. First, my college professors: a Ph.D. in English, a professional journalist, a theater practitioner.</p>

<p>Then, a couple of working screenwriters and a published author, among others.</p>

<p>Today, I've read the King James Bible (the version that sounds like Shakespeare) from cover to cover, understanding every word. Beyond my work, I've written legal documents, screenplays, and poetry that have moved people or impelled them to action.</p>

<p>Few things give me more satisfaction—that deep, soul-enlarging satisfaction—than writing a well-researched, airtight piece, ready to influence the reader.</p>

<p>In English. Or Spanish. It's all the same to me.</p>
