## My Story

Growing up in Chile as a Chilean-American, I daydreamed of writing captivating fiction and nonfiction one day. I saw myself dazzling audiences with my magnificent command of the English language.

But there was one problem: I didn't speak English.

Maybe some, but not enough to hold a conversation.

My teachers were always kind enough to commend my squeaky-clean grammar and rich vocabulary in Spanish.

*One day,* I told myself (in Spanish), *I'll use English at the same level---or even better.*

I was too young to know how thorny that would prove. So, when I was 18, I embraced my American nationality and moved to the US.

The first years were rough. At my first job, HR got involved when I offended a coworker because the word I used didn't mean what I thought it meant. I was too embarrassed to admit to a language deficiency, so I just promised it wouldn't happen again.

Mistakes and misunderstandings were common. For all my efforts, this English thing wasn't coming along.

Could I really do it?

Inch by inch, people started noticing my grammar, spelling, storytelling, and persuasive abilities. First, my college professors: a Ph.D. in English, a professional journalist, a theater practitioner.

Then, a couple of working screenwriters and a published author, among others.

Today, I've read the King James Bible (the version that sounds like Shakespeare) from cover to cover, understanding every word. Beyond content and copy, I've written legal documents, screenplays, and poetry that have moved people or impelled them to action.

I often hear from people some variation of, "Wow, I never would have realized English wasn't your first language!"

Few things give me more satisfaction---that deep, soul-enlarging gratification---than writing a well-researched, airtight piece, ready to influence the reader's life in some small way. Life is good when I get to write.

In English. Or Spanish. They're both the same.
