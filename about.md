Hi, I'm Joseph. I live, breathe, and dream writing so you can focus on running your business without ever worrying about your content.

Thanks to my crazy journey, I believe it's now my duty to empower people through first-rate writing, because I want them to crush their goals even if they don't have the time or inclination to write.

I delight in creating first-rate content that gets readers to take definitive action. I love to use my [storytelling](https://hbr.org/2011/03/using-stories-as-a-tool-of-per) experience to persuade. Every word and phrase I write has a psychological reason behind it; I write no fluff.

## The Background

Through my writing, I've helped some 300 clients---from college students to CEOs---throughout the US improve their personal brands and advance their careers. I've written content for several online publications on business, technology, health, career strategy, and other topics.

I have a bachelor's degree in business management from Brigham Young University--Idaho. I also studied computer science and data science at BYU-I.

Through experience, I've learned that being proficient with grammar isn't enough to be a good writer. The most important thing is being able to craft a message that resonates with readers' reason and emotions, and gets them to take action.

## The Story

Growing up in Chile as a Chilean-American, I daydreamed of writing captivating publications and stories one one day. I saw myself dazzling audiences with my magnificent command of the English language.

But there was one problem: I didn't speak English.

Maybe some, but not enough to hold a conversation.

In school, my teachers were always kind enough to commend my squeaky-clean grammar and rich vocabulary in Spanish.

*One day,* I told myself (in Spanish, of course), *I'll use English at the same level---or even better.*

I was too young to know how thorny that would prove. So, when I was 18, I capitalized on my American nationality and moved to the US.

The first years were rough. At my first job in the States, HR got involved when I offended a coworker because the word I used didn't mean what I thought it meant. I was too embarrassed to admit to a language deficiency, so I just promised it wouldn't happen again.

Mistakes and misunderstandings were daily situations. For all my efforts, this English thing wasn't coming along.

Could I really do it?

Inch by inch, people started noticing my grammar, spelling, persuasive, and storytelling abilities. First, my college professors: a Ph.D. in English, a professional journalist, a theater practitioner.

Then, a couple of working screenwriters and a published author, among others.

Today, I'm known as a captivating writer with a wacky knack for spotting typos out of the corner of my eye. When I reveal my origin, people often say some variation of, "Wow, I never would have realized English wasn't your first language!"

I've even read the King James Bible (the version that sounds Shakespearean) from cover to cover, understanding everything. Beyond content and copy, I've written legal documents, screenplays, and poetry that have moved people or impelled them to action.

Few things give me more satisfaction---that deep, soul-enlarging gratification---than writing a well-researched, airtight piece, ready to influence the reader's life in some way. Life is good when I get to write.

In English. Or Spanish. They're both the same.

## More About Me

Myers-Briggs says I'm an INFJ, the rarest personality type. That makes sense: I'm a full-time introvert with polished social skills and an intuition about what's in other people's minds.

I also have perfect pitch---but don't ask me to play any instruments.
