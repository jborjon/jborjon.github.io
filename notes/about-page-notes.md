# How You Can Leverage My Brain to... (maybe too pushy; focus on being conversational and transparent, not salesy)

"Go run your business. I'll take care of your copy."

Helped some 300 clients to improve their personal brand to advance their careers through writing.

Jerusha's suggestions: let them know I have a wife and two children and run a business.




Hi, I'm Joseph, and I live, breathe, and dream writing so you can focus on running your business without ever worrying about your content again.

If subpar grammar could be [costing you business opportunities](https://hbr.org/2013/03/good-grammar-should-be-everyon), can you imagine what publishing lackluster content could be doing for your reputation?

I don't want you to struggle the same way I did [go into story].

## My Story

Growing up in Chile as a Chilean-American, I daydreamed of writing captivating fiction and nonfiction one day. I saw myself dazzling audiences with my magnificent command of the English language.

But there was one problem: I didn't speak English.

Maybe some, but not enough to hold a conversation.

My teachers were always kind enough to commend my squeaky-clean grammar and rich vocabulary in Spanish.

*One day,* I told myself (in Spanish), *I'll use English at the same level---or even better.*

I was too young to know how thorny that would prove. So, when I was 18, I embraced my American nationality and moved to the US.

The first years were rough. At my first job in the States, HR got involved when I offended a coworker because the word I used didn't mean what I thought it meant. I was too embarrassed to admit to a language deficiency, so I just promised it wouldn't happen again.

Mistakes and misunderstandings were common. For all my efforts, this English thing wasn't coming along.

Could I really do it?

Inch by inch, people started noticing my grammar, spelling, storytelling, and persuasive abilities. First, my college professors: a Ph.D. in English, a professional journalist, a theater practitioner.

Then, a couple of working screenwriters and a published author, among others.

Today, I've read the King James Bible (the version that sounds like Shakespeare) from cover to cover, understanding every word. Beyond content and copy, I've written legal documents, screenplays, and poetry that have moved people or impelled them to action.

I often hear from people some variation of, "Wow, I never would have realized English wasn't your first language!"

Few things give me more satisfaction---that deep, soul-enlarging gratification---than writing a well-researched, airtight piece, ready to influence the reader's life in some way. Life is good when I get to write.

In English. Or Spanish. They're both the same.

## Let's Connect

Do you click with what I've shared with you? Do you have any questions about me? [Drop me a line](/contact) and I'll be in touch.







## To answer:

1. What's my *why,* my undying belief in a purpose or cause bigger than myself? Ideas: To empower individuals and businesses through top [percentile of my writing skills] writing, making it so time and lack of writing mastery aren't an obstacle for creators and business owners, thus improving the economy for everyone.

2. What's my unique value proposition, or what pain do I solve, especially at their struggling moment that makes them decide to look for a copywriter? Talk to them at that moment. (specific, not general: Not "Do your taxes faster," but "Never worry about fitting in taxes in your busy life again." Try a few, see what people think. Copy written "in their words" is best-performing.)

3. What's my struggle-to-success story that affects the reader? Mastering English, starting the struggle at a young age.



## Overview

Main focus: how you solve a problem for the customer.

Connect by creating a story---start with *why*. Usually, you tell your journey from struggle to success. Storytelling boosts conversion rates. Avoid self-praise.

Say how you're going to help visitors specifically. It's always about them, not you. How to do this: instead of focusing on you, focus on how you solve a problem for them.

Use power words, adjectives. Open with a hook, as you would with an article, something that affects them.

Be conversational and choose words that evoke emotion (e.g., *help* instead of *assist*): http://unionez.net/adsezine/Emotions.html

Like any other article, use a benefit-driven headline. Say what you're good at that sets you apart and can benefit the reader. You could also have a sub-headline that further explains your benefits to readers.

Get creative with your unique selling proposition, because there are a lot of freelance writers: success stories, data, statistics, unique abilities that benefit them (e.g. creating copy that gets readers to take definitive action, better-than-competitors' storytelling knowledge and ability), something unique you do to go above and beyond for clients, etc. Put it above the fold. Put it in terms of how it can help them solve the problem.

Promise a solution to their challenges. What problem are they trying to solve? Fix that for them and convey it from headline to CTA.

Most clients want to save time, money and effort, so show how you help with that.

Show who you are and what you offer through an image (doesn't have to be your face).

Use concrete accomplishments to establish reliability and authority.

Deliver the most important and relevant info above the fold---don't make them scroll for answers. (Mention 300 clients throughout entire conterminous US, from coast to coast)

Keep it under 500 words, or 2 minutes for a video.

Use at least one CTA to turn a reader into a customer. Make sure it provides value to them and keep it simple.

Suggestion to overcome friction to reading your page: offer something of value for free without an opt-in form. If it's educational, great, because people are more likely to buy from you after you've educated or informed them.

At any rate, if you can teach your audience anything useful, do it. It makes for a very engaging About page. See this example: https://copyblogger.com/about/

Maybe it could be an insight that comes from me only and not the competition; my way of seeing things. Or how I know the ins and outs of English better than native speakers because I have a different perspective. Typos jump out.

Mention Spanish somewhere. Bilingual proficiency, can work the same magic in both.

Don't tell them how awesome you are; tell them how awesome they can be through you. Tell them what jobs to be done you solve.

Share your personality type (I'm the rarest type!) and its strengths.

Do show that your service is amazing and high-quality. Starting with why and a struggle story are fantastic, but they don't help if your offer isn't top-notch.

"It's not only about being proficient with grammar" (which I am, maybe give hard data from a test), but it's also about crafting a message that touches your readers' emotions and gets them to take action."

"How do you know you're doing it right? Let an expert do it for you."

"You're putting your first impression out there. Let me skillfully craft it for you." (idea from https://designpowers.com/blog/4-reasons-to-hire-a-professional-content-writer)

"The better your content, the more engaged your visitors are, and the more likely they'll become paying customers." (idea from https://designpowers.com/blog/4-reasons-to-hire-a-professional-content-writer)

"I have a purpose for every single word. No fluff. Efficiency."



# Additional ideas

One way of providing value would be to reference [this study](https://hbr.org/2013/03/good-grammar-should-be-everyon) and so teach them the cost of bad grammar, then show that I can fix it to help you get ahead in your career. Heck, that can be a business in itself. Although, beware of correlation vs. causation. (Definitely add grammar and spell correction as a service.)



## For a Video

"Hi. My name is ___ and I [value or selling proposition]."

Videos build trust, reduce friction to reading the page, and can increase conversions by 80 percent.
