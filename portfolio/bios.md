*This is a sample of the many bios I wrote for a counseling center serving hundreds of clients in a major metropolitan area. I changed subjects' names and other personal details to respect their privacy.*

## Marilyn Sattler, LCSW

Marilyn is the founder and CEO of the Center for Healing and Transformation, which she opened in 2016 and now serves hundreds of clients in the Phoenix Metropolitan Area.

She has been a trauma therapist since 2014, when she earned her master's degree from Argosy University. She has enormous success treating those with the most stressful professions—the police, fire, military, SWAT, dispatch, peer-support, and first-responder communities. She treats their families as well.

Marilyn has provided in-person therapy throughout the world. She is trained in EMDR, trauma-focused behavioral therapy, military competency, and treating substance use.

Her clients love her, and for good reason. They’ve expressed many times how much she’s helped them. "For the first time, I have hope," some say. Others go so far as to tell her, "You saved my life."

Under Marilyn's leadership, the Center for Healing has gained a strong reputation with government organizations across the state. Police and fire chiefs seek out her training to create true healing in their departments.

Marilyn is a published author featured in news articles and talk shows. She's highly sought-after as a keynote speaker for first-responder conferences, military events, and critical incident debriefings.

She once presented alongside General Jefferson S. Burton at the unveiling of a monument she erected to honor America’s fallen heroes and their families.

She’s driven by a passion to help others and to make a meaningful difference. In that spirit, she fights for the wellbeing of those whose mental-health needs aren't adequately addressed.

Marilyn and her husband—who serves in the Army Special Forces—have five children. She’s spontaneous and tenacious, and loves motorcycle rides.

## Jeanne Arnold, CMHC

Over her 26 years of practice, Jeanne has earned a reputation as an insightful and caring therapist. She works with clients who struggle with all types of mental health diagnoses, including PTSD, attunement trauma, substance use, neurodevelopmental disorders, and domestic violence.

She has extensive experience working with the military, law enforcement, and firefighter communities. She's had success treating children, adolescents, adults, and families.

Jeanne has advanced training in EMDR, mind-body bridging, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and moral injury treatment, among others.

Her clients are fiercely loyal to her because she is compassionate, committed, and loving—even toward the most challenging of them. They usually do exactly as she tells them; she is kind, but not afraid to point out nonsense.

She is ever the proverbial grandmother, taking care of (and feeding) everyone around her. She knows the power of living with intent and of effective spirituality.

## Mel Morris, CMHC

In his practice, Mel creates a refuge of unconditional safety and acceptance, empowering his clients to heal from their trauma. He specializes in treating the military and veteran communities, first responders, and anyone experiencing challenges with trauma, depression, anxiety, anger management, and substance use.

Mel holds a master's degree in counseling from the University of Phoenix. He has specialized training in trauma-focused, cognitive-behavioral, EMDR, and IFS therapy. In his eight years of practice, his clients consistently report a sense of growth and relief from trauma-related symptoms.

After overcoming his own struggles with the help of counselors, Mel decided to become a therapist himself. His goal is to relieve as much suffering for as many people as possible. He holds his 16-year marriage, sense of humor, and joy of living close to his heart.

## Layla Roberts, CMHC

Layla delights in seeing her clients reach milestones and transform their lives. She focuses on treating depression, anxiety, PTSD, bereavement, personality disorders, and divorce trauma. She works especially well with children, adolescents, and their parents. She also works with the LGBTQ+ community, healthcare workers, first responders, and members of the military.

She earned her master's degree from the University of Phoenix. Later, she trained in trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy and EMDR. She's used both in her eight years of practice, and is a big fan of the latter. Her clients are very successful at overcoming their challenges.

After the death of some of her siblings, Layla decided to become a therapist to help others heal from trauma and find hope. To her, helping children with their mental health and being a general therapist are the best jobs in the world.

Layla believes that therapy isn't necessarily easy, but it's worth it. She has a cheerful personality and takes her work very seriously. Her personal motto comes from The Lion King: "Oh yes, the past can hurt. But the way I see it, you can either run from it or learn from it."

## Ray Waters, Executive Director

As Executive Director of the Center for Healing and Transformation, Ray plays a key role in its development. He provides the strategic direction to fulfill the organization's mission. In other words, he enables the team of therapists to serve their clients in the best way possible.

He manages the business side of operations, making sure the organization can continue helping people heal well into the future. He is the company's face in public relations and business partnership settings.

In his nearly three decades of experience, Ray has served in senior-level positions at many reputable organizations. He holds a bachelor’s degree in finance and an MBA, both from Utah Valley University. He was an adjunct professor of public speaking and business at the University of Utah for six years.

Following his entrepreneurial drive, Ray has started and grown successful business ventures. One of those, a brand-new franchise, gave him the opportunity to act as a state-level media spokesperson and as a member of the national board of directors of the franchisee association. He also participated in the sponsorship of a boxing match between Evander Holyfield and Mitt Romney for charity.

Ray gets a profound sense of satisfaction seeing organizations improve and people grow. Since he came on board in 2020, he has implemented cultural changes and operational efficiencies that have improved the way the company operates. He provides leadership that has helped employees grow in their roles and in their lives.
