      <h1>Take the Cloud With You: A Guide to Edge Computing</h1>
      <p>Over $43 billion. That&#39;s how big <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/press-release/global-edge-computing-market">Grand View Research</a> predicts the edge computing market will be around the world by 2027.</p>
      <p>Have you heard of edge computing? If you haven&#39;t, or you have but don&#39;t quite know what it is, you&#39;re not alone.</p>
      <p>In this guide, we&#39;ll give you a primer so you understand what the buzz is all about and how this technology will affect your life in the future.</p>
      <h2 id="what-is-edge-computing-">What Is Edge Computing?</h2>
      <p>To understand what edge computing is and what its advantages are, we have to start with its relationship to cloud computing. They are different but interrelated technologies.</p>
      <h3 id="cloud-vs-edge-computing">Cloud vs Edge Computing</h3>
      <p>At its core, all computing is about processing data. That&#39;s true of your laptop, your smartphone, and your car&#39;s onboard computers.</p>
      <p>The essential difference between cloud and edge computing is in how—or, rather, where—they process the data they come across.</p>
      <p>Think of how cloud-enabled apps work. Take Siri, for example. You ask her, &quot;Hey Siri, who is the greatest musician of all time?&quot;</p>
      <p>The steps she follows to give you an answer may look something like this:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>Compress the recorded sound of your voice so it uses less network bandwidth</li>
      <li>Send the question as a sound bite to one of Apple&#39;s servers on the cloud</li>
      <li>Without your device&#39;s intervention, the server interprets your voice through a natural language processing algorithm</li>
      <li>The server decides what to do based on its understanding of your question</li>
      <li>The server sends directions to Siri on your device</li>
      <li>Siri heeds the directions she gets from the cloud and responds to your question accordingly</li>
      </ol>
      <p>As you can see, your device doesn&#39;t have much of a say in what happens after you ask the question. The heavy lifting happens on the cloud.</p>
      <h3 id="the-advantage-at-the-edge">The Advantage at the Edge</h3>
      <p>Edge cloud computing is about giving more power and responsibility to devices other than servers.</p>
      <p>What if Siri and other apps could do most of the processing directly on your device and only have to make minimal requests from the cloud?</p>
      <p>Here&#39;s what would happen:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Cloud servers would have less load to handle</li>
      <li>There&#39;d be less data to send back and forth across the network and, therefore, less demand for bandwidth</li>
      <li>There would be a significant reduction in latencies and delays</li>
      <li>The app might even work without an Internet connection</li>
      <li>Your raw data wouldn&#39;t need to travel around so much, which would help protect your privacy</li>
      </ul>
      <p>That&#39;s where we&#39;re headed in the next few years. The changes in the infrastructure are already happening at the enterprise and consumer levels.</p>
      <h2 id="but-what-exactly-is-an-edge-">But What Exactly Is an &quot;Edge&quot;?</h2>
      <p>If servers are the &quot;core&quot; of the cloud, devices that generate data are at the &quot;edge.&quot;</p>
      <p>Your Apple device turning your voice into signals it can recognize—that&#39;s generating data. But it&#39;s not all about mobile edge computing. Examples of <a href="https://medium.com/velotio-perspectives/a-beginners-guide-to-edge-computing-6cfea853aa11">machines at the edge</a> are IoT devices such as smart door locks and light bulbs. There are also network-connected industrial sensors and autonomous vehicles.</p>
      <p>Because of its nature, edge computing won&#39;t edge out cloud computing. The technologies increasingly complement each other.</p>
      <h2 id="how-does-music-benefit-from-this-technology-">How Does Music Benefit From This Technology?</h2>
      <p>The <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11227-018-2511-6">Internet of Music Things</a> is... Well, a thing. It&#39;s the ecosystem of networks and IoT devices dedicated to the production and perception of musical content.</p>
      <p>Imagine the possibilities. We could have a world where musicians are more directly connected to each other and their audience. There may spring up new services for musical diffusion that we couldn&#39;t dream of today.</p>
      <p>Musical teaching and learning could become more streamlined. Smart musical instruments could revolutionize the performance and listening experience.</p>
      <p>Case in point: During Taylor Swift&#39;s 2015 tour for her album <em>1989</em>, attendees received LED bracelets that lit up in sync with the music and lighting of the concert and responded to the wearer&#39;s movement.</p>
      <p>Talk about an immersive experience.</p>
      <h2 id="mobile-edge-computing-the-way-forward">Mobile Edge Computing: The Way Forward</h2>
      <p>Edge computing is quickly becoming more ubiquitous. It aims to make our lives easier and more interconnected.</p>
